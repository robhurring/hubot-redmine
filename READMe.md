# Hubot Redmine

Light mapping of the Redmine REST API that allows hubot access to some basic redmine tasks. Once you have a redmine
user (preferably one with enough access to modify tickets), add the following to your heroku/etc. config:

    heroku config:add HUBOT_REDMINE_BASE_URL="http://redmine.your-server.com"
    heroku config:add HUBOT_REDMINE_TOKEN="your api token here"
