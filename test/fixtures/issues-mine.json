However since the value is not really set in the DB you cannot see it in the issues list, nor can you find any of these issues when searching for it through the filters.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce*\r\n\r\n* Create a new issue.\r\n* Create a new issue custom field (I tried with boolean and text types) with a default value\r\n* look at the previously created issue in issues list (have the custom field displayed) and detail view\r\n* note the different values being shown for the custom field - issue details page shows the configured default, while the issue list shows the field as unset (empty).\r\n* When filtering the issue list for the field's value (or simply looking at the database) it turns out that the field is indeed unset (neither filtering for the field being 'yes' or 'no' turns up the issue). So clearly the details view is lying about the field's true value by replacing _unset_ with the configured default.\r\n\r\n*Desired Behavior*\r\n\r\nImho the default value for unset custom fields (where no corresponding @custom_value@ exists) should only be preset in the edit form, but not when merely showing the issue details. Under all circumstances the details view should be consistent with the issues list in this regard.\r\n\r\nI came up with a patch that checks if there is actually any custom value present in the database for the given field before calling show_value, but it feels more like a workaround than a solution.\r\n\r\nAnother related thing I observed is that, when editing such an issue and setting the custom field's value for the first time and to something other than the default, a journal detail is created saying \"field xy was changed from <default> to <new value>\", though the default was never really set on the field.\r\n\r\nFinally, it might be a useful feature to offer the option of applying the default to all issues (matching tracker / project selection) when saving a custom field with a default set.","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":2,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":4,"name":"Affected version","value":"102"}],"created_on":"2017-04-28T15:13:28Z","updated_on":"2018-06-30T01:39:15Z"},{"id":28882,"project":{"id":1,"name":"Redmine"},"tracker":{"id":1,"name":"Defect"},"status":{"id":9,"name":"Confirmed"},"priority":{"id":5,"name":"High"},"author":{"id":308290,"name":"Bernhard Rohloff"},"assigned_to":{"id":1,"name":"Jean-Philippe Lang"},"category":{"id":25,"name":"Website (redmine.org)"},"subject":"GDPR compliance","description":"Today the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect.\r\nThe regulation could cause severe damage to a non compliant community project, even if it's a non profit one.\r\nAs Richard Rauch mentioned on the \"forum\":http://www.redmine.org/boards/1/topics/55222 redmine.org doesn't seem to comply to the new laws.\r\n\r\nI think GDPR compliance for redmine.org should get checked ASAP.\r\nPerhaps the guys at Planio have some useful advise for their project mother ship.\r\n\r\n","done_ratio":0,"custom_fields":[{"id":2,"name":"Resolution","value":""},{"id":4,"name":"Affected version","value":""}],"created_on":"2018-05-25T12:15:09Z","updated_on":"2018-08-25T22:23:20Z"},{"id":240,"project":{"id":1,"name":"Redmine"},"tracker":{"id":3,"name":"Patch"},"status":{"id":1,"name":"New"},"priority":{"id":4,"name":"Normal"},"author":{"id":143,"name":"David Reese"},"assigned_to":{"id":1,"name":"Jean-Philippe Lang"},"category":{"id":10,"name":"UI"},"subject":"views/user/edit, make password fields not-autocomplete (UI fix)","description":"In the user/edit view, Firefox autofills the first password field.
